- A **design pattern** is a general, reusable solution to a common problem within a context
in software design.

- Patterns are **blueprints** that can be applied in multiple situations, but they are not direct pieces of code.

- They focus on **object interactions, system architecture**, and how classes/objects communicate.

*Benefits of Design Patterns*
-------------------------------
- **Code Reusability**: Patterns provide proven solutions that can be applied in multiple projects.
- **Maintainability**: Encourages clean, understandable, and structured code, which is easier to maintain and extend.
- **Communication**: Design Patterns act as a common language between developers, improving communication and understanding.
- **Scalability**: Design Patterns help in structuring code to support future scaling with fewer refactors.
- **Efficiency**: Avoids reinventing the wheel by using well-tested and widely accepted solutions.
