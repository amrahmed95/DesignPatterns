The **Interface Segregation Principle** ensures that classes are not burdened
with methods they don't need.

It promotes better design by breaking large, general-purpose interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.

it improves ***maintainability, flexibility, and testability*** by ensuring that classes
only have the dependencies they actually require.
